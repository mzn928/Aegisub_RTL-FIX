# Aegisub RTL-Fix
Simple automation script for Aegisub to fix RTL formatting in subtitles by AnimeList Team (Shinsekai_Yuri).

Script works by adding {U+202B} Unicode character to start of each line
and after line breaks (\N) and that magicaly fixes all the RTL problems!

The script has been tested with Persian, But it should work with all the other RTL languages.
